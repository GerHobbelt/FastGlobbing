# Fast String Matching with Wildcards, Globs, and Gitignore-Style Globs

Wildcard string matching and globbing isnâ€™t as trivial as it may seem at first.  In fact, mistakes in the past resulted in serious vulnerabilities such as denial of service due to exponential blow-up in execution time.

This fast non-recursive algorithm performs safe gitignore-style wildcard matching.  Implementations in C, C++, Java, Javascript and Python are included.

Please read my CodeProject article ["Fast String Matching with Wildcards, Globs, and Gitignore-Style Globs - How Not to Blow it Up"](https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/5163931/Fast-String-Matching-with-Wildcards-Globs-and-Giti?msg=5870295#xx5870295xx) for all the gory details.

The fast globbing method is used by the [ugrep](https://github.com/Genivia/ugrep) fast file search tool to match file and directory names.

## Gitignore-style globbing rules

| pattern | matches
| ------- | -------
| `*`     | anything except a `/`
| `?`     | any one character except a `/`
| `[a-z]` | one character in the selected range of characters
| `[^a-z]`| one character not in the selected range of characters
| `[!a-z]`| one character not in the selected range of characters
| `/`     | used at the begin of a glob, matches if pathname has no `/`
| `**/`   | zero or more directories
| `/**`   | when at the end of a glob, matches everything after the `/`
| `\?`    | a `?` (or any character specified after the backslash)
| `~`     | the user's HOME directory (C/C++ versions with TILDE enabled)

## Examples

| pattern    | matches
| ---------- | -------
| `*`        | `a`, `b`, `x/a`, `x/y/b`         
| `a`        | `a`, `x/a`, `x/y/a` but not `b`, `x/b`, `a/a/b`
| `/*`       | `a`, `b` but not `x/a`, `x/b`, `x/y/a`
| `/a`       | `a` but not `x/a`, `x/y/a`
| `a?b`      | `axb`, `ayb` but not `a`, `b`, `ab`, `a/b`
| `a[xy]b`   | `axb`, `ayb` but not `a`, `b`, `azb`
| `a[a-z]b`  | `aab`, `abb`, `acb`, `azb` but not `a`, `b`, `a3b`, `aAb`, `aZb`
| `a[^xy]b`  | `aab`, `abb`, `acb`, `azb` but not `a`, `b`, `axb`, `ayb`
| `a[^a-z]b` | `a3b`, `aAb`, `aZb` but not `a`, `b`, `aab`, `abb`, `acb`, `azb`
| `a/*/b`    | `a/x/b`, `a/y/b` but not `a/b`, `a/x/y/b`
| `**/a`     | `a`, `x/a`, `x/y/a` but not `b`, `x/b`
| `a/**/b`   | `a/b`, `a/x/b`, `a/x/y/b` but not `x/a/b`, `a/b/x`
| `a/**`     | `a/x`, `a/y`, `a/x/y` but not `a`, `b/x`
| `a\?b`     | `a?b` but not `a`, `b`, `ab`, `axb`, `a/b`
