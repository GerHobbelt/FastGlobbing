# Fast String Matching with Wildcards, Globs, and Gitignore-Style Globs

Wildcard string matching and globbing isnâ€™t as trivial as it may seem at first.  In fact, mistakes in the past resulted in serious vulnerabilities such as denial of service.  Simple patches, such as limiting the number of matches to limit the CPU time, have been applied to fix implementations that suffer exponential blow-up in execution time.

This fast non-recursive algorithm performs safe gitignore-style wildcard matching.  Implementations in C, C++, Java, Javascript and Python are included.
